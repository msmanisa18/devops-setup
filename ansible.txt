Configuration Management:
	- Configuration means system specifications.
		Ex: CPU, RAM SSD, how many users are there, how many files are there, what packages installed, what services are running.
	- Management means adding / modifying / deleting any files or directories.
	- If you change any change on your machine means you are doing the configuration management.
	- This management can be done in 2 ways:
		1. Manual - Being done by system admins, they take the remote access and do the changes manually.
		2. Automated - DevOps Engineers do this automation.
	Configuration management is a process which can be automated by: Chef / Ansible / Puppet

IAC (Infrastructure As Code):
	- Create a file, write the code on it, the same file will be executed on all the machines, it will create the infrastructure.
	- We are converting the code to infra, and this process is called as IAC.
	- This code is versionalbe.

Ansible:
	- Ansible is a configuration management tool, written in Python.
		Ex: If we need to install 10 softwares in 20 different machines, it will take more time to do it manually by System Admin team.
			But the same can be done by single DevOps person in few mins.
	- In Ansible we have one server and multiple nodes. We will be installing software on the nodes.
	- Ansible will be installed only in Server, not required on nodes, Master will communicate with nodes by using SSH.
	- We will create a file on Master. This file is called as Playbook where we write the code in YAML.
	- This code will run in nodes where infrastructure will get created.
	- On every nodes there will be one configuration file under etc directory.
	- When we run any Playbook before that one Setup module from Server will verify the configuration. 
	- Then Ansible decides whether the software is already installed or do we need to install.
	- Whatever modules are not there only those modules will get installed, this concept is called as idempotence.
	- Means not repeating the same task again and again.
	- Ansible server will push the code to nodes, so Ansible is Push based where as Chef is Pull based.




Lab:
	- Launch 3 EC2 instances (Amazon Linux T2 Micro 8 GB, total 3 machines, one server, 2 nodes. Rename them accordingly as Master, Node-1, Node-2).
	- Security Group should be SSH and HTTP.

On Node-1:

	1. sudo su
	2. yum update -y
	3. hostnamectl set-hostname node1
	4. bash
	5. useradd user1
	6. passwd user1 ---> 12345

Edit the sudoers file:
	7. vi /etc/sudoers

	Add following line under --> root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
	user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

	## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
	%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
	user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Edit the sshd_config file:
	8. vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	
	PasswordAuthentication yes
	PermitRootLogin yes

	9. systemctl restart sshd



On Node-2:

	1. sudo su
	2. yum update -y
	3. hostnamectl set-hostname node1
	4. bash
	5. useradd user2
	6. passwd user2 ---> 12345

Edit the sudoers file:
	7. vi /etc/sudoers

	Add following line under --> root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
	user2 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

	## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
	%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
	user2 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Edit the sshd_config file:
	8. vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	
	PasswordAuthentication yes
	PermitRootLogin yes

	9. systemctl restart sshd


On Server:

	1. sudo su
	2. yum update -y
	3. hostnamectl set-hostname server
	4. bash
	5. useradd ansadmin
	6. passwd ansadmin ---> 12345

Edit the sudoers file:
	7. vi /etc/sudoers

	Add following line under --> root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
	ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

	## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
	%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
	ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Edit the sshd_config file:
	8. vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	
	PasswordAuthentication yes
	PermitRootLogin yes

	9. systemctl restart sshd

	10. su ansadmin
	11. cd
	12. pwd
	13. ll
	14. ssh-keygen
	15. ssh-copy-id user1@172.31.2.61  - private IP of node-1
	16. ssh-copy-id user2@172.31.12.78 - private IP of node-2
	17. ssh user1@172.31.2.61
	18. ssh user2@172.31.12.78

Now we can connect remotely from server to node, install/remove softwares and files.

Now install ansible:

	1. yum install ansible -y
	2. Go to the location: /etc/ansible
	3. Create a file as hosts - it is the inventry file.
	4. Add server list to inventry file:

Example:
[ansadmin@server ansible]$ cat hosts
[nodelist]
172.31.12.78 ansible_user=user2
172.31.1.94 ansible_user=user1

	5. Create another file as ansible.cfg
	6. Add following contents to it.

[ansadmin@server ansible]$ cat ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory=/etc/ansible/hosts
sudo_user=root

7. Check Ansible version:
[ansadmin@server ~]$ ansible --version
ansible [core 2.15.3]
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/home/ansadmin/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ansible
  ansible collection location = /home/ansadmin/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.9.16 (main, Jul  5 2024, 00:00:00) [GCC 11.4.1 20230605 (Red Hat 11.4.1-2)] (/usr/bin/python3.9)
  jinja version = 3.1.4
  libyaml = True
[ansadmin@server ~]$


8. Check all the nodes connected:

[ansadmin@server ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
  hosts (2):
    172.31.12.78
    172.31.1.94
[ansadmin@server ~]$

9. Check particular server list:
[ansadmin@server ansible]$ ansible nodelist --list-hosts
  hosts (2):
    172.31.12.78
    172.31.1.94
[ansadmin@server ansible]$

10. Check IP of particular node:
[ansadmin@server ansible]$ ansible nodelist[0] --list-hosts
  hosts (1):
    172.31.12.78
[ansadmin@server ansible]$ ansible nodelist[1] --list-hosts
  hosts (1):
    172.31.1.94
[ansadmin@server ansible]$ ansible nodelist[2] --list-hosts
[WARNING]: No hosts matched, nothing to do
  hosts (0):
[ansadmin@server ansible]$
[ansadmin@server ansible]$ ansible nodelist[-1] --list-hosts
  hosts (1):
    172.31.1.94
[ansadmin@server ansible]$ ansible nodelist[-2] --list-hosts
  hosts (1):
    172.31.12.78
[ansadmin@server ansible]$
[ansadmin@server ansible]$ ansible nodelist[0:1] --list-hosts
  hosts (2):
    172.31.12.78
    172.31.1.94
[ansadmin@server ansible]$


Ad hoc commands -- single line commands -- we can use the command directly in server, it will get executed in nodes. Ex:

1. List down files of nodes from server:
[ansadmin@server ansible]$ ansible nodelist -a "ls -l /tmp" -b
[WARNING]: Platform linux on host 172.31.12.78 is using the discovered Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python3.9, but future installation of another Python interpreter could change the
meaning of that path. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.15/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information.

[ansadmin@server ansible]$

2. install java:
ansible nodelist -m yum -a "pkg=java state=present" -b

=====================================================================


1. Under /etc/ansible/ we keep 2 files:
	1. hosts 
		- This file is called as inventory file. It cantains Ip addresses of Nodes.
		- Here we keep IP addresses of Nodes, then only Server will recognize the Nodes.
		- We make the Nodes as groups inside the inventory file.
		- Whenever we will push codes to a particular group, the Server will push codes to all the Nodes present under the group.

			Example:
			[ansadmin@server ansible]$ cat hosts
			[nodelist]
			172.31.12.78 ansible_user=user2
			172.31.1.94 ansible_user=user1

	2. ansible.cfg
		- This is the main configuration file for Ansible.
		- We put the inventory file details in this configuration file.
		
			Example:
			[defaults]
			inventory=/etc/ansible/hosts

2. Ansible Modules:
	- An Ansible module is a small program that performs actions on the nodes specified.
	- When we push some code from server to node, first setup module will go to node and brings the information.
	- Then server analyzes whether to execute the command or not.
	- To explicitly see the setup module, what data it collects, we can use:
		Ex: ansible all -m setup
	Ex:
	1. command module - To run Linux commands on Nodes.
		Ex-1: ansible all -m command -a "ls"
			Here root access is not required, so we can skip -b
		Ex-2: ansible all -m command -a "yum install java -y" -b
			Here root access is required, so we need to add -b
	
	2. copy module - Copy files or directories from server to node.
		Ex: ansible all -m copy -a "src=file_name dest=/tmp/" -b
	
	3. yum module - To deal with packages, installation or removal
		Ex: ansible all -m yum -a "pkg=java state=present" -b
		state=present - means to be installed
		state=absent - to uninstall a package
		state=upgrade - to upgrade the installed package to latest version, if any older version will be there, it will get upgraded to latest one.
		default action for yum module is install, if we will not mention amything (skip state=present), then it will install the package.

	4. service module - To start a service.
		Ex: ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b
		state=started - Service will be started.
		state=restarted - Service will be restarted.
		state=stopped - Service will be stopped.
		ansible all -m command -a "service httpd status" -b
			To check the status of httpd in all the nodes
		default action for service module is start, if we will not mention amything (skip state=started), then it will start the service
	
	5. user module - To create a user
		Ex: ansible all -m user -a "name=test state=present" -b
			- add user
		Ex: ansible all -m user -a "name=test state=absent" -b
			- remove user
		default action for user module is create, if we will not mention amything (skip state=present), then it will create an user.
		Ex: ansible all -m command -a "tail -2 /etc/passwd" -b
			- To see last 2 lines of passwd file
	
	
3. There are 2 ways by which we can write the code in Ansible Server.
	1. Ad-Hoc Commands
		- Ad-hoc commands are great for tasks you repeat rarely. 
			For example, if you want to power off all the machines in your lab for Christmas vacation, you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a playbook. 
		- These are the single line commands. We can use the command directly in server, it will get executed in nodes.
		- If we want to execute only one activity, it can be done via Ad-Hoc commands.
		
		Example: List down files of nodes from server:
			1. ansible all -m command -a "ls"
			2. ansible all -m command -a "ls -l /tmp"
		--> Ansible commands start with ansible.
		--> all --> means each and every group and all the nodes present on the group.
		--> -m --> Means nane of the Module.
		--> -a --> Means arbitrarily, what we give within the double quotes.
		--> command --> This is a module to execute linux commands.
		--> -b --> meaning becoming root
		
		Example: Install Java
		ansible all -m command -a "yum install java -y" -b
		or
		ansible all -m yum -a "pkg=java state=present" -b
		
		
		Check Java version
		ansible all -m command -a "java -version" -b
		
		Example: Install maven
		ansible all -m yum -a "pkg=maven state=present" -b
		
		Copy file:
		ansible all -m copy -a "src=sample,txt dest=/tmp/" -b
		
		
	2. Ansible Playbook
		- If we have multiple tasks to be executed, we should go with Playbook.

		Execute playbook:
			ansible-playbook playbook-ex1.yml



[ansadmin@server ~]$ cat playbook-ex1.yml
---
- name: Playbook to create one user on all nodes
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Create a user with name as testuser1
    user: name=testuser1
...
[ansadmin@server ~]$
