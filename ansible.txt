Configuration Management:
	- Configuration means system specifications.
		Ex: CPU, RAM SSD, how many users are there, how many files are there, what packages installed, what services are running.
	- Management means adding / modifying / deleting any files or directories.
	- If you change any change on your machine means you are doing the configuration management.
	- This management can be done in 2 ways:
		1. Manual - Being done by system admins, they take the remote access and do the changes manually.
		2. Automated - DevOps Engineers do this automation.
	Configuration management is a process which can be automated by: Chef / Ansible / Puppet

IAC (Infrastructure As Code):
	- Create a file, write the code on it, the same file will be executed on all the machines, it will create the infrastructure.
	- We are converting the code to infra, and this process is called as IAC.
	- This code is versionalbe.

Ansible:
	- Ansible is a configuration management tool, written in Python.
		Ex: If we need to install 10 softwares in 20 different machines, it will take more time to do it manually by System Admin team.
			But the same can be done by single DevOps person in few mins.
	- In Ansible we have one server and multiple nodes. We will be installing software on the nodes.
	- Ansible will be installed only in Server, not required on nodes, Master will communicate with nodes by using SSH.
	- We will create a file on Master. This file is called as Playbook where we write the code in YAML.
	- This code will run in nodes where infrastructure will get created.
	- On every nodes there will be one configuration file under etc directory.
	- When we run any Playbook before that one Setup module from Server will verify the configuration. 
	- Then Ansible decides whether the software is already installed or do we need to install.
	- Whatever modules are not there only those modules will get installed, this concept is called as idempotence.
	- Means not repeating the same task again and again.
	- Ansible server will push the code to nodes, so Ansible is Push based where as Chef is Pull based.
